    <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <p>The rocky courtship of two handsome young men is at the center of our gender reversed version of The Taming of
        the Shrew.
        Three women gadding about Italy are taken with the lovely and charming Bianco. They resort to a variety of
        disguises and farcical strategies to win his sweet heart.
        Another young woman, Petruchia, aims to win the hand of Bianco’s older, angrier brother, Nataniele, through a
        campaign of misdirection and gaslighting.
        Two attentive parents try to advocate for their children, and two attentive servants try to advocate for their
        bosses, with varying degrees of success…
